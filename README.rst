    <MayaDT epoch=1481847021>

    >>> tomorrow = now.forwards('one day')
    <MayaDT epoch=1481977021>

    >>> tomorrow.iso8601()
    2016-12-16T00:12:54+00:00

    >>> tomorrrow.iso8601()
    Fri, 17 Dec 2016 00:12:54 +0000

    >>> tomorrow = maya.adjust('tomorrow').datetime
    datetime.datetime(2016, 12, 16, 0, 14, 33, 950436)
