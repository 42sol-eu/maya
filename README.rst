Maya: Datetime for Humansâ„¢
==========================

Datetimes are very frustrating to work with in Python, especially when dealing
with different locales on different systems. This library exists to make the simple things easier, while admitting that time is an illusion (timezones doubly so), and should be interacted with via an API for humans (not machines).

The Usage
---------

Just playing with an API here::

    >>> now = maya.now()
    <MayaDT epoch=1481850660.9>

    >>> tomorrow = maya.when('tomorrow')
    <MayaDT epoch=1481919067.23>

    >>> tomorrow.iso8601()
    '2016-12-16T15:11:30.263350Z'

    >>> tomorrrow.rfc2822()
    'Fri, 16 Dec 2016 20:11:30 -0000'

    >>> tomorrow.datetime()
    datetime.datetime(2016, 12, 16, 15, 11, 30, 263350, tzinfo=<UTC>)

    >>> rand_day = maya.when('2011-02-07', timezone='US/Eastern')
    <MayaDT epoch=1297036800.0>

    # Note how this is the 6th, not the 7th.
    >>> rand_day.day
    6

    # Always.
    >>> rand_day.timezone
    <UTC>

Timezones fit more in here somewhere...


Notes
-----

- This library is based around epoch time, so dates before Jan 1 1970 are not supported. You'll live.
- Don't panic, and always carry a towel.
